So steam expects an exported share
but it also expects explicitly steamapps to be at the root of that dir

you can not pass /games/SteamLibrary
you must instead create a symlink and then place that symlink at the root




Add your user to the input group



Steam NEEDS gdm
No idea what is in there but without it Steam will refuse to forward virtual input to the virtual device it creates in /dev/
Basically no input will function in the game for Steam Input.


If most games (but not all) are giving a black screen on opening them try changing the Steam Proton Runtime (Like from Hotfix to Experimental)
